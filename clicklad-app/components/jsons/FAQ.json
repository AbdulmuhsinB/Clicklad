    "question": "Do I need strapping?",
    "answer": "Our click rail system becomes your strapping. If you are installing the boards horizontally, you will not need strapping. If you are installing the boards vertically, if there is a concern for water getting behind the material, then we suggest adding strapping vertically, and then adding the railings horizontally."

    "question": "What do I need to install?",
    "answer": "For installation, you need a drill to screw the rails to your wall, and you will need a saw with the correct blade to cut aluminum. Installing the boards is super easy and it can be done all by hand."
